# Friday
A REST API which provides you the information of any discord account including their Spotify & VS-Code activity!

This is an open sourced repository initially made for educational purposes, we are using Discord.js & Fastify to make this, if you would like to collaborate or want to implement more things you are free to fork this repository and submit a Push Request when you feel you are good to go!

## How to use
In order to use this you need to clone this repository first by running
```
git clone [repository url]
```
let it clone then run the following commands:
```
cd friday-api
yarn install
```
after running the above commands, you need to create a new file namely `.env` and add your `TOKEN` (Disocrd Bot Token), `GUILD_ID` (The Server's ID in which you want to setup Friday) & then `PORT` (The port you want to host the api on).

after configuring the `.env` file you are now good to run the application by running the following command
```
yarn dev
```
Thanks!
